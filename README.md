# McGill COMP 417 Winter 2026 - Intro to Robotics

## Overview 
Robotics is the study of physical bodies that can perceive and act in the world, and for computer scientists, the focus is on the algorithms, data structures, models and math that makes a robot intelligent. Even with modern hardware, the real world can easily overwhelm a poor algorithm, so often efficient and scalable use of computation equals intelligence.

## Pre-Reqs
- COMP 251, we develop and analyze several complex robotics algorithms that require at least this level of CS algorithmic knowledge.
- MATH 223, working with the continuous, multi-dimensional information about a robot and its sensors takes place in the language of Linear Alg.
- (ECSE 321 or COMP 206) because we will build a variety of hands-on software solutions.

## Topic List
Please see the [lecture list](Lectures) for details and resources.
- Kinematic Models
- Dynamics Models
- Planning Algorithms
- Optimal Control
- Imitation Learning
- Reinforcement Learning
- Human-robot Interaction
- Sensors and Perception
- State Estimation
- Map Building
- Large Robot Models (LRM)
  - Diffusion Policies
  - Transformers for Robot Learning
  - Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models

## Assessment Plan
- (10) in-class quizzes (10%)
- (1) group presentation (10%)
- (3) assignments (20%) 
- (1) hardware Lab (10%) 
- (1) mid-term exam (20%)
- (1) final exam (30%) 

## Resources and Materials
We'll follow a few text books, but material from these will be pointed to and extracted into course notes written by the instructor.

## Instructor: David Meger
- Primary contact method: Ed Discussion posts to discuss content, assessments, exams, etc. Mark posts as private for personalized questions. Email is the last resort for connecting with both the instructor and TAs.
- Email - david.meger@gmail.com (McGill email accounts are currently being “migrated” and not reliable, sorry!)
- Office: MC 112N (North Wing, walk through the 100N lobby to find my door)

## Teaching Assistants
- Amin Abyaneh
- Farnoosh Faraji
- Steve Wen
- Zhizun (Steven) Wang

## Office Hour Schedule
To be determined first week in Jan

## Integrity (including AI)
McGill University values academic integrity. Therefore, all students must understand the meaning and consequences of cheating, plagiarism and other academic offences under the Code of Student Conduct and Disciplinary Procedures.

Robotics technology is now very connected with GenAI. For online assessments we may ask you to use GenAI in some way, including as part of your solution method, to vibe code, or similar. In other cases, we will require responses that are written in your own voice are done by yourself. In that case, text from AI tools will be treated as equivalent to text written by a peer. That is, using it directly and not citing it is plagarism.

## Assessment Language
In accord with McGill University’s Charter of Students’ Rights, students in this course have the right to submit in English or in French written work that is to be graded.
