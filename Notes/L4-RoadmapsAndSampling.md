# Roadmaps and Sampling Planners

So far we've applied standard CS algorithms that work on any graph planning problem, from playing board games to scheduling jobs on a CPU. That is, they were not very "robotic". This week we'll deviate and mention methods that take specific advantage of the continuous, geometric nature of the robot planning problem. Things to notice:
